Title: Sentinel Spy Satellite Simulator - NASA API Edition
Description:
Take command of your own virtual spy satellite with the Sentinel Spy Satellite Simulator - NASA API Edition! This interactive Python-based simulation puts you in the pilot’s seat of a high-tech orbital observatory, blending real-time NASA data with an immersive ASCII art experience. Powered by NASA’s open APIs (EPIC and NeoWs), this tool fetches live Earth imagery coordinates and asteroid proximity alerts, merging them seamlessly into a dynamic satellite control interface.
What It Does:
	•	Real-Time NASA Data: Pulls live telemetry from NASA’s EPIC API (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) for authentic latitude, longitude, and timestamps, plus NeoWs API for near-Earth object events.
	•	Interactive Simulation: Control your satellite with real-time commands—scan sectors, transmit data, or repair systems—via intuitive keypress controls (S, D, C, T, R, Q).
	•	Dynamic Events: Encounter randomized space hazards like debris fields or asteroid alerts (with real NEO data), requiring quick decisions to evade or intercept.
	•	ASCII Art Display: Watch your satellite animate in retro-style ASCII art, with visual states reflecting health, scanning, transmitting, or repairs.
	•	Persistent State: Tracks your satellite’s health, solar power, data collected, and missions completed, saved between sessions.
Features:
	•	NASA API Integration: Uses your NASA API key (or the included demo key) to fetch real data, with robust fallback to simulated telemetry if NASA’s servers are offline (e.g., during rare 503 errors).
	•	Sound Effects: Optional Pygame audio for boot-up, events, scans, and transmissions (requires sound files: boot.wav, event.wav, scan.wav, transmit.wav).
	•	Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, or Linux with Python 3.x, requests, pygame, and colorama libraries.
	•	Customizable: Adjust frame speed, log missions to satellite_log.txt, and tweak solar power regeneration rates.
	•	Educational & Fun: Perfect for space enthusiasts, coders, or educators wanting to explore NASA data interactively.
How to Use:
	1.	Install Python and required libraries (pip install requests pygame colorama).
	2.	Add your NASA API key (get one free at api.nasa.gov) or use the fallback mode.
	3.	Run the script, press any key to boot, and start your mission!
